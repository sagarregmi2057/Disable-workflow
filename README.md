# GitHub Actions – Disable Workflow ❌

Sometimes you want to **temporarily disable a workflow** without deleting it.  
GitHub Actions allows you to do this so the workflow won’t run on any event triggers until re-enabled.

---

## 🔑 Ways to Disable a Workflow

1. **Using `workflow_dispatch` only**  
   - Remove `on: push` or `on: schedule` and only keep manual trigger:
   ```yaml
   on:
     workflow_dispatch:

Workflow will only run when you manually trigger it from GitHub.

2.Comment out or remove triggers

If you don’t want it to run automatically, simply comment out or remove the on: section.

3.Disable workflow in GitHub UI

Go to your repository → Actions → Click on the workflow → “Disable workflow” button.

This stops all automatic and manual runs until re-enabled.
📂 Example: Disabled Workflow
name: Disable Workflow


here we are commenting on: flow
# on: 
#   push:
#     branches: [ main ]
#   schedule:
#     - cron: "0 0 * * *"

# Workflow is disabled by commenting out triggers
jobs:
  demo:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Greetings
        run: echo "This workflow is currently disabled"
